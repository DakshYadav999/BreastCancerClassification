# Breast Cancer Classification 🧬🩺

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on a dataset of breast cancer cases. It provides a full pipeline—from loading and visualizing the data to training and evaluating models.

## 📁 Project Structure

* `Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow—data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and conclusion.

## 🧠 Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, available via `sklearn.datasets`. It contains features computed from digitized images of a breast mass.

* **Target Variable**: `diagnosis` (Malignant or Benign)
* **Features**: Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, etc.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-classification.git
   cd breast-cancer-classification
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb
   ```

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using:

* **Accuracy**
* **Confusion Matrix**
* **Precision/Recall/F1-score**
* **ROC Curve**

## 📈 Results

The notebook displays the model comparisons and identifies the best-performing algorithm based on the metrics above.

## 📌 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can aid in medical diagnoses, offering a potentially valuable tool for early detection of breast cancer.
